        // Original 30 Questions
        { q: "A client diagnosed with Schizophrenia has been taking Haloperidol (Haldol) for 3 days. The nurse assesses high fever (39.5°C), severe muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. What is the priority action?", options: ["Administer PRN Benztropine (Cogentin).", "Hold the medication and notify the healthcare provider immediately.", "Document the findings and continue to monitor.", "Administer acetaminophen for the fever."], answer: 1, rationale: "These are classic signs of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal reaction. Priority is to stop the offending agent and seek immediate help. Benztropine is for EPS, not NMS." },
        { q: "A client prescribed Phenelzine (Nardil) selects pepperoni pizza for lunch. What is the nurse's concern?", options: ["High sodium content causes lithium toxicity.", "High fat content causes diarrhea.", "High Tyramine content risks Hypertensive Crisis.", "The client needs a gluten-free diet."], answer: 2, rationale: "MAOIs require a Tyramine-restricted diet. Cured meats (pepperoni) and aged cheeses are high in Tyramine, leading to Hypertensive Crisis." },
        { q: "A client on Lithium Carbonate has diarrhea, vomiting, tremors, and a serum level of 1.6 mEq/L. How is this interpreted?", options: ["Sub-therapeutic level.", "Therapeutic range (0.6–1.2 mEq/L).", "Mild to moderate toxicity.", "Expected side effects."], answer: 2, rationale: "Therapeutic range is 0.6–1.2 mEq/L. A level >1.5 mEq/L with GI symptoms indicates toxicity." },
        { q: "A client on Clozapine (Clozaril) requires which weekly lab monitoring due to fatal side effects?", options: ["Liver Function Tests (AST/ALT)", "WBC and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)", "BUN and Creatinine", "Serum Glucose and HbA1c"], answer: 1, rationale: "Clozapine is associated with Agranulocytosis (severe drop in WBCs), causing vulnerability to fatal infections." },
        { q: "A client taking Lithium asks about starting a low-sodium diet. What is the best response?", options: ["Yes, lowering sodium is good for the heart.", "No, low sodium causes lithium toxicity.", "Increase sodium to prevent side effects.", "Diet has no effect on lithium."], answer: 1, rationale: "Lithium is a salt. If sodium intake decreases, the kidneys retain lithium, leading to toxicity." },
        { q: "The nurse is assessing a client on Chlorpromazine. Which of the following is NOT a symptom of Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)?", options: ["Severe restlessness (Akathisia)", "Muscle spasms of neck/jaw (Dystonia)", "Shuffling gait (Pseudoparkinsonism)", "High fever and severe autonomic instability"], answer: 3, rationale: "High fever and autonomic instability indicate Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), not EPS. Options A, B, and C are classic EPS signs." },
        { q: "A client prescribed Alprazolam (Xanax) for panic attacks needs which discharge instruction?", options: ["You may take this with a glass of wine.", "Stop immediately if you feel sleepy.", "Do not drive until you know how this drug affects you.", "It takes 2-4 weeks to work."], answer: 2, rationale: "Benzodiazepines cause sedation. Alcohol potentiates CNS depression. They work immediately, not in weeks." },
        { q: "A client on Fluoxetine (Prozac) for two weeks reports feeling 'jittery'. What is the best explanation?", options: ["These are common transient side effects.", "You are allergic to the medication.", "Stop the medication immediately.", "Take the medication at night."], answer: 0, rationale: "Common side effects of SSRIs include insomnia and agitation (jitteriness). These usually subside in a few weeks." },
        { q: "A client scheduled for Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) makes a statement requiring further teaching:", options: ["I will be given anesthesia.", "I might have short-term memory loss.", "This treatment will cure my depression forever.", "I need to sign an informed consent."], answer: 2, rationale: "ECT is an effective treatment, not a permanent cure. Maintenance therapy is often needed." },
        { q: "A client says, 'I'm a terrible person. I don't deserve to live.' What is the most therapeutic response?", options: ["Why do you feel that way?", "You are not a terrible person.", "It sounds like you are feeling very hopeless right now.", "Let's play cards to distract you."], answer: 2, rationale: "This uses Restating/Reflecting, acknowledging feelings without judgment. 'Why' questions are non-therapeutic." },
        { q: "What is the primary goal during the Orientation Phase of the nurse-client relationship?", options: ["Promoting insight.", "Establishing trust and formulating a contract.", "Overcoming resistance.", "Evaluating goal attainment."], answer: 1, rationale: "The Orientation Phase is about building rapport, trust, and setting the boundaries/contract." },
        { q: "A client with severe depression says, 'My family would be better off without me.' Priority intervention?", options: ["One-to-one observation and suicide precautions.", "Encourage journaling.", "List three things to be grateful for.", "Administer antidepressants immediately."], answer: 0, rationale: "Safety is priority. The client is expressing suicidal ideation." },
        { q: "A client asks the nurse personal questions. Which response maintains boundaries?", options: ["I live in Quezon City.", "Why do you want to know?", "I prefer not to answer that. Let's focus on you.", "I have two kids."], answer: 2, rationale: "This sets a limit on social interaction and redirects focus back to the client." },
        { q: "A client yells, 'You are just like my mother! You never listen!' This is an example of:", options: ["Countertransference", "Transference", "Resistance", "Boundary Violation"], answer: 1, rationale: "Transference is displacing feelings from a past person onto the nurse." },
        { q: "A client asks, 'Should I divorce my husband?' Which response is NON-therapeutic?", options: ["What are the pros and cons?", "I think you should give it more time.", "This seems like a difficult decision.", "How does talking about this make you feel?"], answer: 1, rationale: "Giving Advice ('I think you should...') is non-therapeutic as it removes client autonomy." },
        { q: "A nursing student fails an exam and yells at their sibling. Which defense mechanism is this?", options: ["Projection", "Displacement", "Reaction Formation", "Sublimation"], answer: 1, rationale: "Displacement is transferring feelings from a stressful situation to a less threatening target." },
        { q: "Which of the following is NOT a criteria for Mental Health in the PRAISE acronym?", options: ["Reality Perception", "Autonomous Behavior", "Absence of all stress", "Environmental Mastery"], answer: 2, rationale: "PRAISE includes Positive attitude, Reality, Autonomy, Integrative capacity, Self-actualization, Environmental mastery. Total absence of stress is impossible." },
        { q: "According to Maslow, which client need is the priority?", options: ["Spiritual comfort.", "Safety from anxiety.", "Food and sleep (physiological).", "Self-esteem."], answer: 2, rationale: "Physiological needs (food, sleep) are the base of the pyramid and must be met before safety." },
        { q: "A 5-year-old starts wetting the bed after a new sibling is born. This is:", options: ["Repression", "Regression", "Reaction Formation", "Displacement"], answer: 1, rationale: "Regression is returning to an earlier developmental stage in response to stress." },
        { q: "A community is devastated by a typhoon. Survivors are wandering aimlessly. What type of crisis is this?", options: ["Maturational", "Situational", "Adventitious", "Internal"], answer: 2, rationale: "Adventitious Crisis is a crisis of disaster (natural or man-made) affecting a community." },
        { q: "According to Erikson, the task for a 75-year-old client is:", options: ["Intimacy vs. Isolation", "Generativity vs. Stagnation", "Ego Integrity vs. Despair", "Identity vs. Role Confusion"], answer: 2, rationale: "Late Adulthood (65+) involves Ego Integrity vs. Despair." },
        { q: "According to Freud, which part of personality induces guilt when you want to do something wrong?", options: ["Id", "Ego", "Superego", "Conscious"], answer: 2, rationale: "The Superego represents the moral principle/conscience and induces guilt." },
        { q: "A 9-year-old child organizes baseball cards by team. Piaget calls this stage:", options: ["Sensorimotor", "Preoperational", "Concrete Operational", "Formal Operational"], answer: 2, rationale: "Concrete Operational (7-11 yrs) involves logical thinking and classification." },
        { q: "A group member consistently boasts and seeks attention. This role is:", options: ["Monopolizer", "Recognition Seeker", "Harmonizer", "Gatekeeper"], answer: 1, rationale: "The Recognition Seeker calls attention to self through boasting." },
        { q: "Parents argue but focus on their son's grades to avoid their own conflict. This is:", options: ["Enmeshment", "Triangulation", "Scapegoating", "Double Bind"], answer: 1, rationale: "Triangulation is pulling a third person into a conflict to reduce tension between two others." },
        { q: "Gradual exposure to a feared stimulus (like a spider) while relaxing is called:", options: ["Flooding", "Aversion Therapy", "Systemic Desensitization", "Modeling"], answer: 2, rationale: "Systemic Desensitization pairs relaxation with gradual exposure." },
        { q: "Using a drug that causes nausea when alcohol is consumed is an example of:", options: ["Systemic Desensitization", "Flooding", "Aversion Therapy", "Operant Conditioning"], answer: 2, rationale: "Aversion Therapy pairs a negative stimulus (nausea) with an unwanted behavior." },
        { q: "In family therapy, the 'identified patient' is viewed as:", options: ["The cause of problems.", "The healthiest member.", "The symptom bearer for the family dysfunction.", "The only one needing help."], answer: 2, rationale: "The identified patient expresses the symptoms of the larger family system issue." },
        { q: "Which Philippine law is the Mental Health Act?", options: ["RA 9165", "RA 11036", "RA 7160", "RA 10354"], answer: 1, rationale: "Republic Act No. 11036 is the Mental Health Act." },
        { q: "Conducting a stress management seminar for healthy students is which level of care?", options: ["Primary Level", "Secondary Level", "Tertiary Level", "Rehabilitative Level"], answer: 0, rationale: "Primary Level is health promotion and illness prevention before a condition occurs." },
        
        // NEW 50 QUESTIONS (Neuroanatomy & Psychopharmacology)
        { q: "A client has become impulsive, sexually inappropriate, and aggressive after a head injury. The nurse suspects injury to which lobe?", options: ["Parietal Lobe", "Temporal Lobe", "Frontal Lobe", "Occipital Lobe"], answer: 2, rationale: "The Frontal Lobe controls organization of thought, body movement, memories, emotions, and moral behavior. Injury here often results in personality changes and loss of impulse control." },
        { q: "A client with severe anxiety is pacing and hyperventilating. The nurse understands that the 'emotional brain' is known as the:", options: ["Cerebellum", "Limbic System", "Reticular Activating System", "Brain Stem"], answer: 1, rationale: "The Limbic System (including amygdala and hippocampus) is the center for emotions, memory, and learning. It regulates the 'fight or flight' response." },
        { q: "A client is having difficulty maintaining balance and coordination while walking. This symptom suggests a disturbance in which brain structure?", options: ["Cerebellum", "Hypothalamus", "Thalamus", "Pons"], answer: 0, rationale: "The Cerebellum is responsible for coordination of voluntary movements and maintenance of balance and equilibrium." },
        { q: "The nurse is teaching a client about the cause of Schizophrenia. Which statement accurately describes the neurotransmitter hypothesis?", options: ["Deficiency of Acetylcholine.", "Excess of Dopamine activity.", "Serotonin levels are dangerously high.", "GABA levels are excessive."], answer: 1, rationale: "Excess Dopamine (or oversensitivity of receptors) is the leading theory for Schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications block dopamine receptors." },
        { q: "A client with Major Depressive Disorder is prescribed an SSRI. The nurse explains that this drug helps by:", options: ["Increasing Serotonin in the synaptic cleft.", "Blocking the production of Serotonin.", "Increasing the destruction of Serotonin.", "Mimicking the effect of Dopamine."], answer: 0, rationale: "SSRIs block the 'reuptake' (recycling) of serotonin, leaving more serotonin available in the synapse to improve mood." },
        { q: "Which neurotransmitter is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, responsible for reducing anxiety?", options: ["Glutamate", "Norepinephrine", "GABA", "Histamine"], answer: 2, rationale: "GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Benzodiazepines work by increasing GABA activity to reduce anxiety." },
        { q: "A client asks how a PET scan is different from a CT scan. What is the nurse's best response?", options: ["PET uses magnets.", "CT shows structure; PET shows chemical function.", "PET is faster and cheaper.", "There is no difference."], answer: 1, rationale: "Structural imaging (CT, MRI) shows anatomy. Functional imaging (PET, SPECT) shows physiology (blood flow, metabolism, receptor activity)." },
        { q: "A client asks why antidepressants take weeks to work. The nurse's best explanation relies on the concept of:", options: ["Neuroplasticity", "First-pass effect", "Receptor downregulation/sensitization", "Blood-brain barrier penetration"], answer: 2, rationale: "Therapeutic effects take weeks because brain receptors need time to adapt (downregulate or sensitize) to the increased neurotransmitter levels." },
        { q: "A client has suffered a stroke affecting the frontal lobe. Which behavioral change should the nurse anticipate?", options: ["Difficulty hearing.", "Inability to recognize objects.", "Impaired judgment and impulse control.", "Loss of sensation in fingers."], answer: 2, rationale: "The frontal lobe controls executive function, personality, and voluntary motor activity." },
        { q: "The nurse assesses a client who cannot identify a key placed in their hand while their eyes are closed (astereognosis). The nurse suspects dysfunction in the:", options: ["Parietal Lobe", "Occipital Lobe", "Temporal Lobe", "Frontal Lobe"], answer: 0, rationale: "The parietal lobe interprets somatic sensory input (touch, pain, spatial relationships)." },
        { q: "A client reports 'hearing voices'. The nurse understands that auditory hallucinations arise from abnormal activity in which area?", options: ["Occipital Lobe", "Temporal Lobe", "Cerebellum", "Brain Stem"], answer: 1, rationale: "The temporal lobe contains the primary auditory cortex and is involved in hearing and memory." },
        { q: "A client falls and hits the back of their head, resulting in 'cortical blindness'. Which lobe was likely injured?", options: ["Frontal", "Parietal", "Temporal", "Occipital"], answer: 3, rationale: "The occipital lobe is the visual processing center." },
        { q: "A client presents with vital sign instability (irregular respirations and fluctuating heart rate) after a head injury. The nurse prioritizes monitoring for damage to the:", options: ["Brain Stem (Medulla Oblongata)", "Corpus Callosum", "Hippocampus", "Thalamus"], answer: 0, rationale: "The brain stem controls vital life functions (cardiac and respiratory regulation)." },
        { q: "The 'Locus Coeruleus' is the primary source of which neurotransmitter associated with the stress response?", options: ["Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Norepinephrine", "Acetylcholine"], answer: 2, rationale: "The locus coeruleus produces norepinephrine, influencing the 'fight or flight' response." },
        { q: "A client with Parkinson’s disease has difficulty initiating voluntary movements due to degeneration of neurons in the:", options: ["Substantia Nigra", "Amygdala", "Hypothalamus", "Wernicke’s Area"], answer: 0, rationale: "The substantia nigra produces dopamine involved in motor control." },
        { q: "The nurse explains that the 'Hypothalamus' is responsible for regulating:", options: ["Long-term memory.", "Basic drives like hunger, thirst, sleep, and temp.", "Logical reasoning.", "Voluntary muscle coordination."], answer: 1, rationale: "The hypothalamus maintains homeostasis (appetite, circadian rhythms, temp)." },

        { q: "The nurse is assessing for the Obturator Sign. Which movement causes pain in a client with appendicitis?", options: ["Extension of the right thigh.", "Internal rotation of the flexed right thigh.", "Palpation of the LLQ.", "Coughing or sneezing."], answer: 1, rationale: "This movement irritates the obturator muscle, which is inflamed due to the appendix." },
        { q: "A client with Peritonitis is placed in a Semi-Fowler’s position. The primary rationale is:", options: ["To facilitate breathing and localize purulent drainage to the pelvis.", "To prevent pressure sores.", "To reduce abdominal pain.", "To increase cardiac output."], answer: 0, rationale: "Gravity keeps the infection lower in the abdomen (pelvis) rather than letting it spread up to the diaphragm/lungs." },
        { q: "A client with diverticulosis asks how to prevent future flare-ups (diverticulitis). The nurse recommends:", options: ["A low-residue diet.", "A high-fiber diet with plenty of fluids.", "Taking daily antibiotics.", "Avoiding all physical activity."], answer: 1, rationale: "High fiber prevents constipation, which is the root cause of diverticula formation." },
        { q: "Which medication is commonly used to treat the anaerobic bacteria in Diverticulitis?", options: ["Vancomycin.", "Metronidazole (Flagyl).", "Acyclovir.", "Prednisone."], answer: 1, rationale: "Metronidazole targets anaerobic bacteria common in the gut." },
        { q: "A client with appendicitis asks why they cannot have a heating pad for the pain. The nurse explains:", options: ["Heat masks the symptoms of infection.", "Heat increases blood flow and could cause the appendix to rupture.", "Heat causes skin burns on the abdomen.", "Heat is only used for muscle spasms."], answer: 1, rationale: "Heat increases inflammation and pressure, risking perforation." },
        { q: "Which IBD condition is described as 'transmural,' affecting the entire thickness of the bowel wall?", options: ["Ulcerative Colitis.", "Crohn’s Disease.", "Diverticulitis.", "Irritable Bowel Syndrome."], answer: 1, rationale: "This deep inflammation is why Crohn's patients are prone to fistulas." },
        { q: "A client with Crohn’s disease has 'steatorrhea.' The nurse recognizes this is due to:", options: ["Bleeding in the colon.", "Malabsorption of fats in the small intestine.", "Excessive bile production.", "Rapid gastric emptying."], answer: 1, rationale: "Crohn's often affects the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed." },
        { q: "What is the curative surgical procedure for Ulcerative Colitis?", options: ["Bowel resection.", "Total Proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy.", "Appendectomy.", "Nissen Fundoplication."], answer: 1, rationale: "Since UC is limited to the colon/rectum, removing them cures the disease (unlike Crohn's)." },
        { q: "A client with IBD is taking corticosteroids (Prednisone). Which side effect should the nurse monitor for?", options: ["Hypoglycemia.", "Weight loss.", "Increased risk of infection / masked infection.", "Hypotension."], answer: 2, rationale: "Steroids suppress the immune system. They also cause hyperglycemia and weight gain." },
        { q: "Smoking has what effect on Crohn’s Disease?", options: ["It is protective and reduces symptoms.", "It has no effect.", "It worsens the disease and increases the risk of flare-ups.", "It only affects the lungs, not the gut."], answer: 2, rationale: "Smoking is a major risk factor for worsening Crohn's." },
        { q: "What is a fistula?", options: ["A telescoping of the bowel.", "An abnormal tunnel/connection between two hollow organs.", "A blockage in the bowel.", "A swollen vein."], answer: 1, rationale: "Common in Crohn's (e.g., enterovesical fistula between bowel and bladder)." },
        { q: "A client has a 'volvulus.' The nurse explains this to the family as:", options: ["The bowel twisting on itself.", "The bowel telescoping into itself.", "A tumor blocking the bowel.", "A lack of peristalsis."], answer: 0, rationale: "Volvulus is twisting; Intussusception is telescoping." },
        { q: "A client with a bowel obstruction has an NG tube. The nurse notes the drainage has stopped. What is the first nursing action?", options: ["Remove the tube.", "Irrigate the tube with saline (per protocol) to check patency.", "Notify the provider.", "Increase the suction pressure."], answer: 1, rationale: "The tube is likely clogged. Verify patency before assuming the obstruction is resolved." },
        { q: "Why does a high small bowel obstruction cause metabolic alkalosis?", options: ["Loss of bicarbonate in stool.", "Loss of gastric acid (HCl) through vomiting.", "Retention of CO2.", "Kidney failure."], answer: 1, rationale: "Stomach acid is acidic; losing it leaves the body alkaline." },
        { q: "What is 'adhesiolysis'?", options: ["Surgery to remove a tumor.", "Surgery to cut scar tissue bands (adhesions) causing obstruction.", "Surgery to place a feeding tube.", "Surgery to remove the appendix."], answer: 1, rationale: "Adhesions from previous surgeries are a common cause of mechanical obstruction." },
        { q: "Following a hemorrhoidectomy, a client reports feeling faint and needing to defecate, but produces no stool. The nurse suspects:", options: ["Constipation.", "Internal hemorrhage (blood pooling in the rectum).", "Gas pains.", "Reaction to anesthesia."], answer: 1, rationale: "Blood in the rectum mimics the sensation of stool pressure. Faintness suggests volume loss." },
        { q: "What is the active ingredient in 'Tucks' pads often used for hemorrhoids?", options: ["Lidocaine.", "Witch Hazel.", "Hydrocortisone.", "Menthol."], answer: 1, rationale: "Witch Hazel provides cooling and astringent relief." },
        { q: "Which lifestyle change is the most effective long-term treatment for hemorrhoids?", options: ["Daily enemas.", "Avoiding sitting for long periods.", "Low-residue diet.", "Limiting fluid intake."], answer: 1, rationale: "Prolonged sitting increases venous pressure in the anal canal." },
        { q: "A client with cirrhosis has spider angiomas and palmar erythema (red palms). These are caused by:", options: ["High ammonia levels.", "Inability of the liver to metabolize estrogen.", "Portal hypertension.", "Vitamin K deficiency."], answer: 1, rationale: "The liver normally clears hormones. Excess estrogen causes vascular changes." },
        { q: "Why is a client with cirrhosis at risk for drug toxicity?", options: ["The kidneys are failing.", "The liver cannot metabolize medications efficiently.", "The client is likely dehydrated.", "The client has low protein."], answer: 1, rationale: "Drug metabolism is a major liver function. Doses often need to be lowered." },
        { q: "A client with ascites complains of difficulty breathing. What is the nurse's priority intervention?", options: ["Administer oxygen.", "Place the client in High Fowler’s position.", "Prepare for intubation.", "Turn the client to the left side."], answer: 1, rationale: "Ascites pushes up on the diaphragm. Sitting up allows the diaphragm to expand." },
        { q: "What is the purpose of checking 'Clotting Factors' (PT/INR) before a liver biopsy?", options: ["To see if the patient is anemic.", "Because the liver produces these factors, and bleeding risk is high.", "To check for infection.", "To determine if the patient needs platelets."], answer: 1, rationale: "The liver makes fibrinogen and prothrombin. A damaged liver = high bleeding risk." },
        { q: "A client with hepatic encephalopathy is agitated. Why should sedatives be avoided or used with extreme caution?", options: ["They cause hypertension.", "The liver cannot break them down, leading to prolonged effects and deeper coma.", "They increase ammonia production.", "They interfere with Lactulose."], answer: 1, rationale: "The failing liver cannot clear the sedative, worsening the mental status." },
        { q: "A client is scheduled for an ERCP. Which assessment is essential post-procedure?", options: ["Urine output.", "Gag reflex.", "Peripheral pulses.", "Pupillary response."], answer: 1, rationale: "ERCP involves passing a scope down the throat. Gag reflex return is safety priority." },
        { q: "In Acute Pancreatitis, the enzyme 'autodigestion' process means:", options: ["The stomach digests the pancreas.", "Pancreatic enzymes activate inside the pancreas instead of the intestine.", "The liver attacks the pancreas.", "Bacteria destroy the pancreas."], answer: 1, rationale: "Trypsin activates early, digesting the pancreatic tissue itself." },
        { q: "Which sign indicates 'hypocalcemia' in a client with pancreatitis?", options: ["Chvostek’s Sign (facial twitch).", "Murphy’s Sign.", "McBurney’s Sign.", "Cullen’s Sign."], answer: 0, rationale: "Tapping the facial nerve causes a twitch due to low calcium neuromuscular excitability." },
        { q: "Why is 'Morphine' now acceptable for pancreatitis pain (despite old teachings about the Sphincter of Oddi)?", options: ["It is not acceptable.", "It is the most effective pain reliever, and spasm evidence is rare/inconclusive.", "It lowers fever.", "It cures the inflammation."], answer: 1, rationale: "Your slides explicitly list Morphine, Fentanyl, and Hydromorphone as appropriate." },
        { q: "A client with gallstones has clay-colored stools. This indicates:", options: ["The stones are in the gallbladder.", "The stones have obstructed the Common Bile Duct.", "The client is bleeding.", "The client is healing."], answer: 1, rationale: "Bile cannot reach the intestine to color the stool brown." },
        { q: "What does 'F' stand for in the '5 Fs' risk factors for Cholelithiasis?", options: ["Forty, Female, Fat, Fertile, Fair.", "Fifty, Fit, Fasting, Fiber, Fish.", "Forty, Fit, Fiber, Female, Fasting.", "Fever, Fatigue, Fainting, Fear, Fracture."], answer: 0, rationale: "Classic mnemonic for gallstone risk." },
        { q: "Why is a low-fat diet recommended for gallbladder disease?", options: ["Fat causes constipation.", "Fat stimulates cholecystokinin (CCK), causing the gallbladder to contract and pain.", "Fat increases stomach acid.", "Fat blocks the liver."], answer: 1, rationale: "Reducing fat prevents the painful contraction of the inflamed organ." },
        { q: "A client has had a Barium Swallow. What instructions should the nurse provide regarding fluids?", options: ["Limit fluids to prevent nausea.", "Drink plenty of fluids to flush the barium and prevent impaction.", "Drink only hot liquids.", "Avoid dairy products."], answer: 1, rationale: "Barium hardens like cement if not flushed out." },
        { q: "During a Colonoscopy, the scope reaches which part of the anatomy?", options: ["Only the rectum.", "The sigmoid colon.", "The cecum (start of large intestine).", "The duodenum."], answer: 2, rationale: "It views the entire colon. (Sigmoidoscopy only views the end)." },
        { q: "What is the correct sequence of abdominal physical assessment?", options: ["Palpate, Inspect, Auscultate, Percuss.", "Inspect, Palpate, Percuss, Auscultate.", "Inspect, Auscultate, Percuss, Palpate.", "Auscultate, Inspect, Palpate, Percuss."], answer: 2, rationale: "Look, Listen, then Touch. Touching first alters bowel sounds." },
        { q: "High-pitched, 'tinkling' bowel sounds indicate:", options: ["Normal bowel function.", "Paralytic ileus.", "Early intestinal obstruction.", "Peritonitis."], answer: 2, rationale: "Fluid and gas under pressure squirting through a narrow lumen." },
        { q: "A client needs a stool sample for 'O&P' (Ova and Parasites). The nurse knows this checks for:", options: ["Occult blood.", "Worms and eggs.", "Fat content.", "Bacteria."], answer: 1, rationale: "Often ordered if parasitic infection (like Ascaris mentioned in slides) is suspected." },
        { q: "What is 'Ascaris'?", options: ["A type of bacteria.", "A parasitic worm that can cause obstruction.", "A viral infection.", "A fungal infection."], answer: 1, rationale: "Your slides mention 'Anti-helminthic if caused by bolus of Ascaris' (worms)." },
        { q: "A client with Hepatitis is in the 'Icteric' phase. What is the primary sign?", options: ["Flu-like symptoms.", "Jaundice (Yellow skin/sclera).", "Recovery.", "Ascites."], answer: 1, rationale: "Icterus = Jaundice." },
        { q: "A client with liver failure has 'Fetor Hepaticus.' The nurse identifies this as:", options: ["A fruity/musty breath odor.", "A hand tremor.", "A skin rash.", "A mental state."], answer: 0, rationale: "Caused by accumulated digestive byproducts the liver can't clear." },
        { q: "Why is 'Atropine' kept ready during an EGD or Barium enema?", options: ["To speed up the heart if vagal stimulation causes bradycardia.", "To sedate the patient.", "To stop vomiting.", "To treat an allergic reaction."], answer: 0, rationale: "Manipulation of the GI tract can trigger a vagal response, slowing the heart." },
        { q: "A client has 'rebound tenderness' at McBurney’s Point. This suggests:", options: ["Cholecystitis.", "Appendicitis.", "Gastritis.", "Kidney Stones."], answer: 1, rationale: "RLQ pain specifically indicates Appendicitis." },
        { q: "A client with Pancreatitis has elevated glucose (Hyperglycemia). The nurse treats this with:", options: ["Oral hypoglycemics.", "Insulin sliding scale.", "Glucagon.", "Glucose tabs."], answer: 1, rationale: "Needs insulin replacement because the pancreas is damaged." },
        { q: "Which hepatitis viruses are prevented by vaccines?", options: ["Hep C and D.", "Hep A and B.", "Hep E and C.", "Only Hep B."], answer: 1, rationale: "Vaccines exist for A and B. There is no vaccine for C." }
